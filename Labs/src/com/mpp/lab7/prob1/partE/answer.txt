1. When type D is a class
- If B and C provide a default implementatation 
 i. Class D redeclares the method itself  (even if unimplemented). 
 ii. Class D explicitly chooses one of them using interfaceName.super.methodName()
 
2. When type D is an Interface
When the two interfaces A and B each have a method with the same signature:
i. If one of the method in the interfaces is a default method, 
interface D must override the method (or declare it as an abstract method) 
– can’t simply do nothing.
ii. If one of the method in the interfaces is a default method, 
interface D must provide a default method (i.e. an implementation) of this method, 
or declare the method (even if unimplemented). (This rule requires no special effort.)
