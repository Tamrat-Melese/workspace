1.	
a.	Name two differences between imperative and functional programming
I. In imperative programming loop is part of the job 
but in functional programming recursion is used

II. In imperative reading and understanding the code is not easy 
but in functional programming the code is clear, straight forward.

III. Imperative mainly focuses on how to do the activity, it goes through 
every detail steps to write a code but in functional programming 
simply describes the method without specifying the detail.

b.	Explain the meaning of declarative programming. Give an example.
Decorative programming describes the method without specifying 
the detail of how it is done, it describes a set of conditions, 
and lets the system figure out how to fulfill them.

examples???

c.	Explain the difference between functional interface, functor, and closure, 
and give examples of each using Java 7 syntax
A functional interface is an interface with only one abstract class.
Functor is a function inside a class and is a typed data structure that encapsulates some value(s) .
Closure in java can be defined as a lambda expression together with 
the values of the free variables that are captured by the lambda expression. 
It can also be said that Closure is a term for a block of code 
with the values of free variable, lambda is a closure.

examples???

d.	Name three benefits of including functional style programming in Java
It is stateless, 
It simply takes parameters passed to them
Describes the method without specifying the why
Functions are referred first class citizens. Can be passed as parameter and can be referenced.
e.	Express the functions defined below using Java 8  lambda notation:
i.	f(x) = x + 2x2  
x → x + 2 * x * x

ii.	g(x,y) = y – x + xy
(x,y) → y – x  + Math.pow(x,y)

iii.	h(x,y,z) = z – (x + y)
(x,y,z) → z – (x + y)

f.	For each lambda expression below, name the parameters and the free variables.
i.  Runnable  r = () →
	{
		int[][] products = new int[s][t];
		for (int i = 0; i <s; i++) {
			for(int j = i + 1; j < t; j++) { 
				products[i][j] = i * j; 
			}    
		}
	}
"s & t" are free variables and it doesn't have parameters.

ii. BiFunction<U, V, R> f = (double u, double v) →
 b
∫ cos⁡ux sin⁡vx dx
a
"a & b" are free variables and "u & v" are  parameters.

iii.Comparator<String> comp = (s, t) →
	{
		if(ignoreCase == true)	{
			return s.compareToIgnoreCase(t);
		} else {
			return s.compareTo(t);
		}
	}	
"ignoreCase" is free variable and "s & t" are parameters.


h.	An example of a method reference is  
System.out::println
Do the following:
i.	Convert this method reference to a lambda expression. 
s → System.out.println(s)

ii.	Determine which type of method reference this is (in the lecture three 
different types of method reference were mentioned). Explain carefully.

staticObject::instanceMethod
"System" is a class in Java.lang package
"System.out" is a static object of printStream class in java.io package and 
"println()" is an instance method of the printStream class

j. An example of a method reference is: 
Math::random 
Its corresponding functional interface is Supplier<Double>. Do the following:
i. Rewrite this method reference as a lambda expression
Supplier<Double> random = ()-> Math.random();

ii. Put this method expression in a main method in a Java class and use it to print a random number  to the console
iii. Create an equivalent Java class in which the functional behavior of Math::random is expressed using an inner class (implementing Supplier); call this inner class from a main method and use it to output a random number to the console. The behavior
